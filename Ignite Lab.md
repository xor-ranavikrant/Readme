This lab explores an end-to-end implementation of an open standard data Lakehouse. You have the opportunity to explore raw data ingestion from disparate data sources that transforms data by using Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks. The ingestion creates data products that can be further leveraged by data science, machine learning, and business intelligence applications.
This lab will demonstrate the capability of Lakehouse to serve as a single platform for managing and supporting data and analytics needs.
You will work through an example of a real world implementation for the fictitious Wide World Importers Enterprise.



Wide World Importers is a brick and mortar retailer that has hundreds of stores worldwide and a fast-growing online store. It sells a wide variety of consumer merchandise, including sunglasses, sports shoes, watches, wallets, books, and various beach products.

The lab scenario starts on May 30th, 2021. The company's new CEO, April, recently noticed negative trends in their KPIs, including:

- High customer churn
- Declining sales revenue
- High bounce rate on their website
- Poor customer experience

In a purely reactive mode, as soon as the company saw these adverse KPI trends, they launched some traditional campaigns. On September 5 (Labor Day), the results of those campaigns were received. The company noticed that the campaigns failed to be effective.

So, April talked with Rupesh, the chief data officer (CDO), about these adverse KPI trends and recommended a data-driven approach.

In this Exercise you will act as a Data Engineer. Rupesh would like you to improve the above KPIs using the following requirements:

- Leverage data from the past, present, and future (Volume).
- Enable quick turnaround time (Velocity).
- Support open standards data format (Variety).

### Exercise 1: Data ingestion from spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse <a name="data-ingestion"></a>

As the data engineer at Wide World Importers, you will start by landing data from a variety of sources into the Lakehouse. This data will be further cleansed, processed, and conformed by using Azure Databricks and Delta Live Tables. You will prepare the data for downstream consumption by data scientists and business intelligence analysts. Data sources include data related to its customers, products, marketing campaigns, social media, and sales transactions. This data is often generated in raw files format such as CSV, JSON, unstructured files, and even images. A lot of existing data is historical data.

To boost customer satisfaction, gain a competitive advantage, and ultimately drive revenue growth, Wide World Importers wants to analyze the data to obtain meaningful insights related to their customers, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. However, their immediate challenge is to generate and use near real-time streaming data. So, they installed IoT devices in their stores to track customer shopping patterns and thermostat readings. They also set up Azure Data Explorer (ADX) with anomaly detection to correlate in-store traffic and store temperatures. As a result, they now have a large volume of real-time streaming data related to in-store traffic, temperature readings and anomaly detection.

In this exercise, you will explore how to ingest near real-time data into the Lakehouse and derive meaningful insights.


#### Task 1.1: Explore a Streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX and Event Hub for a NRT (near real time) analytics scenario. <a name="streaming-data"></a>

Wide World Importers wants its customers to have a pleasant in-store shopping experience. Maintaining the optimal temperature in stores and wine coolers is one way to accomplish this objective.

Consider that the Black Friday Sale in-store event has just started at 6:00 AM EST, and customers are arriving in large numbers at the Miami store. As described earlier, thermostat data from the stores is streamed in real-time to an Azure Event Hub and then into an Azure Data Explorer (ADX) pool for analysis.

In this task, you will use ADX to explore thermostat data from the stores streamed in near real time to an Azure Event Hub.

#### Task 1.2: Explore a few Synapse pipelines that ingest data from analytical data sources to the Bronze layer of the lake. <a name="analytical-sources"></a>

  
Now that you have helped Wide World importers ingest real-time data into the Lakehouse, it has enabled a pleasant shopping experience for their customers during the Thanksgiving sale, your next challenge is to ingest historical data. To do that, consider what happened on September 5, 2021, the day when the traditional campaigns failed. On this day, a lot of historical raw data came from various operational and data analytics sources into the data lake. This data came from both traditional relational and analytical databases, as well as structured files such as CSV, semi - structured files such as JSON, and even unstructured binary files such as images and PDFs.

Some of the data subject areas that you will ingest into the Lakehouse for analysis will be campaign data from Snowflake, in-store transactional data from Azure SQL Database, online sales data from Oracle, and churn data from Teradata. You will now explore some Azure Synapse pipelines that enable ingestion of data from these historical sources to the Bronze layer of the Lakehouse (ALDS Gen2).


In this task, you will explore the design of two Synapse pipelines that are designed to ingest raw data coming from various analytical sources into the data lake.

### Exercise 2: Explore offline data and analytics pipeline using ADB Delta and Delta Live Tables. Land data from streaming pipe in the Lake and connect with non-streaming data to build a simple Lakehouse to serve Exercise 3. <a name="delta-live-table-pipeline"></a>
Analyzing disparate data sources in an integrated way has been a challenge for Wide World Importers. In the past, different teams at the company were assigned to analyze customer churn, social media trends, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. So, it was left to business analysts and executives to synthesize these datasets into a data-driven decision making solution. By delivering a Lakehouse with Azure Databricks and Azure ML, it will become simple for teams to collaborate on a unified workspace to process, analyze, and model data.

In this exercise, you will stitch sets of data together to support meaningful insights. You will set up an Azure Databricks Delta Live Table (DLT) pipeline to build a simple Lakehouse. The pipeline will enrich the data by scoring it with machine learning models to help better understand customers and how to improve service.

The data source for the pipeline is the Bronze layer in ADLS Gen2, which was loaded by the Synapse pipeline in Exercise 1. This layer stores Twitter messages, customer subscription data, traditional campaigns data (which failed on September 5), and store transactions data.

#### Task 2.1: Set up Azure Databricks environment

In this task, you will set up the Azure Databricks environment.

1.	In the Azure portal web session (tab), in the search box (located across the top of the page), enter: **Azure Databricks**

2.	In the search results pane, select **Azure Databricks**.

![Select Azure Databricks](media/images/image2102.png)

![Wating for the job to complete](media/images/image2317.png)

*You have now added the ML notebooks to the DLT pipeline.*

This pipeline is based on the medallion architecture, an extremely simple but powerful design pattern for organizing your Lakehouse.

“Bronze” data is usually raw, unprocessed data from source systems.

“Silver” data is created by cleaning and organizing raw data for further analysis and exploration.

“Gold” data are the finished analytical products – star schema tables for BI applications, engineered features for ML models, and shareable data assets for third parties, Data Mesh architectures, and other downstream consumers.

As you can see in this diagram, all the data is first landed in the Lakehouse where it is further processed into different medallion layers as discussed earlier.

The Twitter sentiment and campaigns data is stitched together to create a combined data product which is further consumed in the next exercise for ML and BI use cases.

All the tables and machine learning models created in Azure Databricks are governed in Databricks' Unity Catalog, which captures lineage, metadata, access controls, and a full audit history.

This information can then be piped into Microsoft Purview as part of an overall view of your Azure data estate. By being designed around simplicity, openness, and collaboration, the Lakehouse is an extremely powerful architecture for addressing the many unique and interesting problems of a modern cloud data stack ready to be leveraged by Wide World Importers.


11. **Observe** the data lineage of Bronze, Silver and variety of Gold tables.

![Medallion Architecture](media/images/image2318.png)



Congratulations! As data engineers, you have now set up a solid foundation of fully stitched data comprised of historical and streaming realtime data from disparate sources including some key data transformations.

### Exercise 3: Data Science and Analytics on the Lakehouse <a name="data-science-and-analytics-on-the-Lakehouse"></a>
#### Task 3.1: Explore an ML model implemented using ADB managed MLflow and operationalized as an ML service using MLOps in Azure ML/AI. <a name="ml-model-using-mlflow"></a> 

Architecture diagram shows the end-to-end MLOps pipeline using the Azure Databricks managed MLflow. 
Now that we've ingested and processed our customer data, we want to undersand what makes one customer more likely to churn than another, and ultimately see if we can produce a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a given customer will churn.

We would also like to understand out customer's sentiment better, so as to create targeted campaign and improve our sales. 

For a data science team charged with creating this model, they will usually undergo a set of key tasks: 

- exploring data to understand the features available, any interesting patterns that can be found, and its potential for training such a model
- running tools such as a hyperparameter sweep to identify the best performing algorithm for the model
- validating the model against a holdout dataset, and registering the model if its performance is sustained over the unseen data
- deploying the model to production to be used against real-world data - in this case, our full customer base to identify churn candidates and take preventive actions

With the prepared data, they examined the customer churn effect as related to the tenure of the month and the total amount spent by them. Here we can see, a low churn rate in cases where customer tenure is high and where they spend more with Wide World Importers. 

We will use the popular xgboost library to train a more accurate model. One way to improve a model’s perfomance is to test different hyperparameters. Rather than doing this through trial and error, Databricks is able to use a “parallel hyperparameter sweep” to train multiple hyperparameter configurations at the same time, using Hyperopt and SparkTrials. As before, the code tracks the performance of each parameter configuration with MLflow.
  

4. **Point** to cmd 29.
  

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3115.png)
  

You can visualize the different runs using a parallel coordinates plot, which shows the impact of different parameter values on a metric here.

![Open the Ignite Report](media/images/image3228.png)

 27. The report has 3 sections,
 - Customer Churn Report
 - Campaign Analytics
 - Website Analytics
 
![PowerBI Report Name](media/images/image3227.png)

1.  Lets navigate to **Churn Analysis Tab,** we analyze the Customer Churn for World Wide importers customers. Here we can see  the probabilty of customer churn is based on two factors. Namely, the tenure of the customers and their purchase amount.

  

![PowerBI Report Buttons](media/images/image3228.png)

2.The top left Scatter Chart shows the Customers, the black color in the legend represents the Customers who are more likely to Churn, and the blue color shows Customers who are less likely to churn.

3.Here we can we can see on the scatter plot chart that most of their loyal customers are those who have been shopping with them for a longer period of time and who also spend larger amounts. On the other hand, we see that most of the customers who are likely to churn are those with lesser tenure (or shopping history) and also lower purchase amount.  
With this insight, it is clear to Wide World Importers, that in order to have a successful CyberMonday Sale event, they need to attract newer customers who spend lesser. They also need to know more about where the most customer churn is happening and leverage the lessons learned from their campaigns to target this population of customers. Let's see first where the churn is happening.    

![abcdef](media/images/image3229.png)


4.**Point** towards the bottom right Bar Chart.

The bar chart explains the probability of customer churn depending on various conditions. We see a few more factors now affecting customer churn. Namely, the online delivery channel and customers who had to interact with customer support. So, that answers where the churn is happening. It seems the highest churn is in their online channel! They need to fix that quickly before the CyberMonday event! To do that, they need to launch new campaigns based on lessons learned from the prior failed campaigns on Sep 5th. Let's see what those prior campaigns revealed...
 
![abcdef](media/images/image3234.png)

  
  

5.  **Point** towards the word cloud, to show the hashtag size based on the revenue generated through the campaign. It is obvious that the largest revenue generated can be attributed to #GoGreen and #SustainableFashion. But let us re-confirm that based on the number of tweets for those hashtags...



![abcdef](media/images/image3235.png)

6.  **Point** towards the Bar chart, to show the number of tweets by hashtags.

Here on this  bar chart most popular hastags with most tweets on twitter are ‘**GoGreen’** and **'sustainable fashion’**. So that confirms our insight from this data is that most of the customers are environmentally conscious and want to purchase climate friendly green products which are sustainable as well.
  
So, armed with all this information, Wide World Importers launches new campaigns to attract customers who have lesser tenure, spend lesser and who prefer the online channel and are also environmentally conscious. The outcome? Let us see next!



  

![abcdef](media/images/image3236.png)

  Here we see our new campaigns data and get even more insights 

1.  **Click** on the Campaign Analytics tab from the top right pane to navigate to the Campaign Analytics report.
  

![abcdef](media/images/image3238.png)

Here on this Campaigns report, from the Bar chart we can obviously see our most popular campaings launched are ‘gogreen’ and  ‘sustainablefashion’. No surprise that these also have the highest revenue among all other campaigns we launced
These new campaigns were run by Wide World Importers globally. So, let us take a moment to see how these campaigns fared in different countries.


  

![abcdef](media/images/image3239.png)

  

2.  The Donut chart shows the revenue generated by the countries after running the new campaigns. Clearly these campaigns were a huge success in USA and Germany. The prospects for CyberMonday sale are now looking even better...


![donutchart](media/images/image3240.png)

  

3.  **Click** on the generations to see the branches change, and **click** on the campaign names to see the revenue.

  

Here we see another way to gather insights about their campaigns. It is by the use of a decomposition tree. This decomposition tree has different levels to show campaigns reaching different age groups through social media, events, and emails. As an illustration you can see here the revenue generated by country and campaign name. In this example, USA has generated the highest revenue when the campaign name was ‘Southbeach’ and they used social media for the outreach, and the generation was baby boomers.
Now, let us turn our attention to website analytics since that is so key for success in the CyberMonday event...
  

![abcdef](media/images/image3241.png)
 

  


**Click** on Website Analytics from the top right pane to navigate to the Website Analytics Report.

Here we see an immediate issue for Wide World Importers.

![Website Analysis Report page](media/images/image3242.png)

  

1.Their Bounce rate is high. Looks like a large population of their customers/ visitors leave their website without much activity. They need to find out more about the root cause of this high bounce rate. So let us look at the next graph which shows the reason behind the high bounce rate...

  

![abcdef](media/images/image3242a.png)



Per this Donut chart it seems that the bounce rate is high because around 60 % of the online Customers are not happy. Let us understand more about these "not happy" customers. What age group are they? What do they shop for and what devices they use to shop online? 


  

![abcdef](media/images/image3242b.png)

3.Click on "Not Happy" on the Donut chart to filter the report page.

![WebsiteAnalyticsPage](media/PowerBI-Images/websiteAnalytics-page1.png)

  

1.  The site visitor by age group chart shows that most of the "Not Happy" Customers are in the  age group of 21 to 40. So, it seems Millennials form the majority of unhappy online customers...let us see what these millenials typically shop for online...
 
 ![WebsiteAnalyticsPage](media/PowerBI-Images/websiteAnalytics-page2.png)

2 . Here on this bar chart we can see which Products they are searching on the website. 

![WebsiteAnalyticsPage](media/PowerBI-Images/websiteAnalytics-page3.png)


**Hover** over the bar chart to see Product Images.Here we can see most of the millennial customers are searching for beach products and adventure sports.

Now lets move on to the next chart which shows some insights about the devices used by these millennials to shop online.

1. On this column chart we can they most of our "Not Happy" Customers are browing our website on a mobile phone.
   
![WebsiteAnalyticsPage](media/PowerBI-Images/websiteAnalytics-page4.png)


Now lets deep dive to get more insights about the factors which have the most occurence in groups of customers who are "Not Happy"

 1.  **Click** on the key Influencers button to navigate to the Key Influencers page.
   

![abcdef](media/images/image3246.png)

 

Let's click on the dropdown and select "Not Happy" to see the factors.

 : Happy | : Not Happy

1. We can see that millennials form the biggest not happy customer segment.
2. Customers are also not happy when they could not find the product they searched for on the website.
3. Customers are also not happy when they were redirected to Wide World Importers website from a third party website.
4. Customers are also not happy whent the website user experience on their mobile phones is not good.
5. Most of the customers not happy because they are not able find discounts on the website.

Ultimately we can say that we need to improve the user experience on the Website for Product search and make sure it renders correctly on the Mobile phone.



![abcdef](media/images/image3247.png)

  
 Now, another interesting angle is to see even amongst the "Not Happy" set of customers, what top segments can they focus on. Lets navigate to Top Segments for additional insights generated.

 1.  **Click** on the Top Segments to show the details.

48. **Click** on bubble 1 to see the details for segment 1.

 
 

The bubbles show the segment of the population who are not happy.
![abcdef](media/images/image3248.png)


48. **Click** on bubble 1 to see the details for segment 1.
Segment 1 shows that 94.5 % of the "not happy" customers experienced failed product searches. By looking at customer segment category, these are  millennials who are using their mobile devices for shopping.

![abcdef](media/images/image3249a.png)
 
 
 
  Now lets click on Decomposition button to  navigate to Decomposition Tree chart

The decomposition tree which shows a similar scenario based on age group categories as to who are happy or unhappy based on various conditions.


![abcdef](media/images/image3249b.png)

So, thanks to Power BI, it is clear to Wide World Importers how to improve their bounce rate. They quickly implement a mobile-friendly website with super fast and convenient product search capabilities, focussing mainly on the products most in demand with millennials. These changes reduce their not happy online customers and thereby improve their bounce rate dramatically. As a result they have a resounding success with uprecedented sales at their CyberMonday Sale event. 
Now, let us see how on an ongoing basis if there are business needs to run adhoc time-critical queries, it can be achieved via custom queries. We will discuss that in more detail in the next task.  
------------- 

#### Task 3.3: Explore SQL Analytics with Synapse. <a name="sql-analytics-with-synapse"></a>

Data Engineers are often called upon to support with adhoc and possibly time-critical queries aside from the canned reports we have discussed so far.
So, let us see how Azure SQL Analytics can also perform custom SQL and BI workload on the data lake in addition to supporting the reports discussed thus far. In this exercise, we will query the data from Data Lake using Azure Synapse Analytics.

Synapse serverless SQL pools is a service to query data in data lakes. Key is that data can be accessed without the need to copy data into SQL tables. Typically, serverless pools are not used to serve external APIs.
Here are the steps involved...

**Steps:**


1. **Search** “Synapse Analytics”.

2. **Click** on Azure Synapse Analytics.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3302.png)

3. **Click** on Synapse workspace shared with you.

>**Note**: You might see Synapse workspace name with different suffix in your Azure Portal.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3303.png)

4. **Click** on **Open** Synapse Studio.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3304.png)

Welcome to **Azure Synapse Analytics!**

In Azure Synapse, we can use T-SQL to directly query data within a data lake for rapid data exploration.

To enable easy exploration and transformation of data in our data lake we can use a serverless SQL pool.

5. **Click** on Develop hub.

6. **Expand** SQL scripts section.

7. **Select** SQL scripts ‘1 Query Campaign And Twitter Data Using TSQL’.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3307.png)

We can directly query external files stored in Azure storage without copying or loading data into a specialized store, all using familiar T-SQL dialect.

A default, built-in, endpoint for this service is provided within every Synapse workspace.

8. **Select** TSQL script.

9. **Connect** with Serverless pool 'IgniteServerlessPool'.

10. **Click** on Run.

11. **View** the result.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3311.png)

Let’s create a view over Campaign file in Serverless pool. With the relevant metadata and placed in an Azure storage account.

12. **Select** TSQL script for creating a view.

13. **Click** on Run.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3313.png)

There you go. This is how easily data engineers can run adhoc time-critical queries on Synapse. We can do the same even with Databricks. Let us take a look...

#### Task 3.4: Explore SQL Analytics with Azure Databricks. <a name="explore-sql-analytics-with-azure-databricks"></a>


Azure Databricks provides an environment that allows you to run quick ad-hoc SQL queries on your data lake. Queries support multiple visualization types to explore query results from different perspectives.

In this task, we as data engineers are exploring a few of the SQL Analytics features with Azure Databricks.

Here are the steps...

**Steps:**

1. **Search** “Azure Databricks”.

2. **Click** on Azure Databricks.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3402.png)

3. **Click** on Azure Databricks service shared with you.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3403.png)

4. **Click on** Launch Workspace.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3404.png)


5. Go to “04_SQL_Analytics_On_Delta_Live_Tables” Notebook in Databricks workspace.

![abcdefgh](media/images/image3.4.png)

6. Review Raw Twitter Data - Bronze
Our bronze layer stores the raw, unprocessed data from our Twitter API pulls. By leaving it in its raw state, we give ourselves the option to reprocess it for different purposes in the future. Thanks to Azure Data Lake Gen 2, we can maintain this data for as long as we need it at very low costs. The bronze layer is usually the domain of data engineers who then build pipelines to refine this data forward into the silver layer.

![abcdefgh](media/images/imageRawData.png)

7. Scroll down to cmd 7.

**Curated Twitter Data - Silver**

In our silver layer, we've curated our raw Twitter data into something more usable for data scientists. They can take these cleaned up, detailed level tables and develop features for machine learning models as well as aggregated analytical datasets for data analysts.

8. Scroll down to cmd 9.

**Curated Twitter Data - Gold**

In our gold layer, we can enhance and refine our silver data sets even further into fit-for-purpose tables and views for specific analytical needs. Here we've augmented our Twitter data with a machine learning model identifying the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of each Tweet so we can get a sense of how the Twitter tags we're analyzing are being used.


7. Scroll down to cmd 17.

**Aggregations Are A Great User Experience Enhancement**

By pre-emptively aggregating our data that rarely or slowly changes, we can provide a great performance benefit for our end users. Our DLT pipeline performs this aggregation of hashtag counts by the geolocation of the Tweets. By only updating this each time we ingest more Tweets, we can keep the aggregation table up to date and then quickly consume and visualize it in tools like Power BI.One nice feature of Databricks notebooks is if a cell produces a DataFrame output (like the one below), you can also profile the data as well as generate quick visualizations. Throw in Markdown and comments and notebooks are a super convenient way to collaborate and communicate with your team, leadership, customers, and other stakeholders.

8. Scroll down to cmd 20

**Z-Order Optimization**

Z-Ordering is a technique to colocate related information in the same set of files.This co-locality is automatically used by Delta Lake on Databricks data-skipping algorithms.This behavior dramatically reduces the amount of data that Delta Lake on Databricks needs to read


9. Scroll down to cmd 22.

**Caching**

Caching reduces scanning of the original files in future queries. It basically caches contents of a table in Apache Spark cache. If a query is cached, then a temp view is created for this query.

10.  Scroll down to cmd 24.

**Time Travel**

In audit history above We can view the history of the different versions of the table and load and display any of those versions.In the exercise below we have displayed data in a specific version
---

### Exercise 4: Tee up the Purview <a name="tee-up-the-purview"></a>

  

In Exercise 1, you loaded raw data into the Lakehouse. Then, in Exercise 2, you used a Delta Live Table pipeline to transform it into a data product for downstream consumption by analysts. 

In Exercise 3, you applied machine learning operations on this data product to build a customer sentiment model. This sentiment analysis allows Wide World Importers to determine which hashtags are trending so they can customize their campaigns to improve their sales while retaining their existing customers.

Meanwhile, Microsoft Purview provides a unified data governance service that helps manage and govern Wide World Importers’ data, which is stored in multi-cloud environments and in data sources such as Oracle, Teradata, ADLS Gen2, and Azure SQL Database.

In this exercise, you’ll explore the Microsoft Purview setup.

#### Task 4.1: Explore Microsoft Purview

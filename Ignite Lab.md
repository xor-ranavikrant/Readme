This lab explores an end-to-end implementation of an open standard data Lakehouse. You have the opportunity to explore raw data ingestion from disparate data sources that transforms data by using Delta Live Tables in Azure Databricks. The ingestion creates data products that can be further leveraged by data science, machine learning, and business intelligence applications.
This lab will demonstrate the capability of Lakehouse to serve as a single platform for managing and supporting data and analytics needs.
You will work through an example of a real world implementation for the fictitious Wide World Importers Enterprise.


Wide World Importers is a brick-and-mortar retailer that has hundreds of stores worldwide and a fast-growing online store. It sells a wide variety of consumer merchandise, including sunglasses, sports shoes, watches, wallets, books, and various beach products.

The lab scenario starts on May 30th, 2021. The company's new CEO, April, recently noticed negative trends in their KPIs, including:

- High customer churn
- Declining sales revenue
- High bounce rate on their website
- Poor customer experience

In a purely reactive mode, as soon as the company saw these adverse KPI trends, they launched some traditional campaigns. On September 5 (Labor Day), the results of those campaigns were received. The company noticed that the campaigns failed to be effective.

So, April talked with Rupesh, the chief data officer (CDO), about these adverse KPI trends and recommended a data-driven approach.

In this Exercise you will act as a Data Engineer. Rupesh would like you to improve the above KPIs using the following requirements:

- Leverage data from the past, present, and future (Volume).
- Enable quick turnaround time (Velocity).
- Support open standards data format (Variety).

Here is the visual representation of the exercise that we are going to perform in this lab.

### Exercise 1: Data ingestion from a spectrum of analytical and operational data sources into the Lakehouse. <a name="data-ingestion"></a>

As the data engineer at Wide World Importers, you will start by landing data from a variety of sources into the Lakehouse. This data will be further cleansed, processed, and conformed by using Azure Databricks and Delta Live Tables. You will prepare the data for downstream consumption by data scientists and business intelligence analysts. Data sources include data related to its customers, products, marketing campaigns, social media, and sales transactions. This data is often generated in raw files format such as CSV, JSON, unstructured files, and even images. A lot of existing data is historical data.

To boost customer satisfaction, gain a competitive advantage, and ultimately drive revenue growth, Wide World Importers wants to analyze the data to obtain meaningful insights related to their customers, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. However, their immediate challenge is to generate and use near real-time streaming data. So, they installed IoT devices in their stores to track customer shopping patterns and thermostat readings. They also set up Azure Data Explorer (ADX) with anomaly detection to correlate in-store traffic and store temperatures. As a result, they now have a large volume of real-time streaming data related to in-store traffic, temperature readings and anomaly detection.

In this exercise, you will explore how to ingest near real-time data into the Lakehouse and derive meaningful insights.


#### Task 1.1: Explore a Streaming data and analytics pipeline using ADX for a near real time analytics scenario. <a name="streaming-data"></a>

Wide World Importers wants its customers to have a pleasant in-store shopping experience. Maintaining the optimal temperature in stores and wine coolers is one way to accomplish this objective.

Consider that the Black Friday Sale in-store event has just started at 6:00 AM EST, and customers are arriving in large numbers at the Miami store. As described earlier, thermostat data from the stores is streamed in real-time to an Azure Event Hub and then into an Azure Data Explorer (ADX) pool for analysis.

In this task, you will use ADX to explore thermostat data from the stores streamed in near real time to an Azure Event Hub.

### Exercise 2: Explore offline data and analytics pipeline using open Delta format and Azure Databricks Delta Live Tables. Stitch streaming and non-streaming data landed earlier to create a combined data product to build a simple Lakehouse. <a name="delta-live-table-pipeline"></a>

Analyzing disparate data sources in an integrated way has been a challenge for Wide World Importers. In the past, different teams at the company were assigned to analyze customer churn, social media trends, marketing campaigns, and sales forecasts. So, it was left to business analysts and executives to synthesize these datasets into a data-driven decision making solution. By delivering a Lakehouse, it will become simple for teams to collaborate on a unified workspace to process, analyze, and model data.

In this exercise, you will stitch two sets of data together to generate actionable insights. You will set up an Azure Databricks Delta Live Table (DLT) pipeline to build a simple Lakehouse. The pipeline will enrich the data by scoring it with machine learning models to help better understand customers and how to reduce churn.

The data source for the pipeline is the Bronze layer in ADLS Gen2, which was loaded by the Synapse pipeline in Exercise 1. This Bronze layer contains campaigns data, customer churn data, store transactions data, sales data and Twitter messages.

#### Task 2.1: Set up Azure Databricks environment <a name="adb-env"></a>

![ADB_Initial_Setup](media/images/image2107.png)


*In exercise 1, we extracted data from a spectrum of data sources and landed it into ADLS Gen 2 data lake. To access this data from ADLS Gen2 data lake, we need to mount it on Azure Databricks filesystem. Executing this script will mount ADLS Gen2 to Azure Databricks.*

---

#### Task 2.2: Review sentiment analysis model training. <a name="sentiment-model"></a>

In this task, you will explore the sentiment analysis model training notebook. This notebook is used to retrieve the model ID thatâ€™s used by the DLT pipeline for further data processing.

*Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing where the text is contextually mined to identify and extract subjective information in source material to understand whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.*

1.	To open a different workspace, at the left, select the **Workspace** icon.

2.	Select the **02_Twitter_Sentiment_Score_Pred_Custom_ML_Model** workspace.

![Twitter_Sentiment_Score_Pred_Custom_ML_Model](media/images/image2202.png)

> **Note: DO NOT** run this script.
> This image is for informational purposes only.
> Due to time constraints, we will not run this notebook in the lab session.

*Running this script will generate a ML model ID. This Model ID is used by the Delta Live Pipeline that we will create in the next task to perform ML operations on Twitter data.* 

---


#### Task 2.3: Create a Delta Live Table pipeline. <a name="dlt-pipeline"></a>

In this task, you will create a Delta Live Table pipeline.

*Delta Live Tables (DLT) makes it easy to build and manage reliable data pipelines that deliver high-quality data on Delta Lake. DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery.*

7.	In the **Storage location** box, enter: **/mnt/delta-files/lakedb/**

8.	In the **Target** box, enter: **lakedb**

9. Select **Create**.

![Select Create](media/images/image2315.png)


*Once you select **Create**, it will create the Delta Live Table pipeline with all the notebook libraries added to the pipeline.*

> **Note: DO NOT** select **Start**.

*If you click on **Start**, Databricks will start executing the pipeline which will take approximately 10 minutes.*

> **Note:** The following instructions are for informational purposes only. Due to time constraints, we will not start the pipeline in the lab session.

![Wating for the job to complete](media/images/image2317.png)

*The lab insrtuctor will share with you the pipeline lineage. Please follow the lab instructor to understand the pipeline lineage in detail.*

10. **Observe** the data lineage of Bronze, Silver and variety of Gold tables.

![Medallion Architecture](media/images/image2318.png)

This pipeline is based on the medallion architecture, an extremely simple but powerful design pattern for organizing your Lakehouse.

**Bronze** data is usually raw, unprocessed data from the source systems.

**Silver** data is created by cleaning and organizing raw data for further analysis and exploration.

**Gold** data is the finished analytical products â€“ star schema tables for BI applications, engineered features for ML models, and shareable data assets for third parties, Data Mesh architectures, and other downstream consumers.

As you can see in this diagram, all the data is first landed in the Lakehouse where it is further processed into different medallion layers as discussed earlier.

The Twitter sentiment and campaigns data is stitched together to create a combined data product which is further consumed in the next exercise for Machine Learning and Business Intelligence use cases.

This information can be then piped into Microsoft Purview as a part of an overall view of your Azure data estate. By being designed around simplicity, openness, and collaboration, the Lakehouse is an extremely powerful architecture for addressing the many unique and interesting problems of a modern cloud data stack ready to be leveraged by Wide World Importers.



Congratulations! As a data engineer, you have now set up a solid foundation of fully stitched data comprised of campaigns data and Twitter data from disparate sources including some key data transformations.

![Upload report upload](media/images/imageFilePath.png)

11.	Notice that a Power BI report and dataset have been added to your workspace.

12.	To open the report, select the **IgniteDemoReport** report.

![Power BI report added to your workspace.](media/images/image3212.png)


13. This report has three sections:
 - Churn Analysis
 - Campaign Analytics
 - Website Analytics
 

![PowerBI Report Name](media/images/image3227.png)

14.  Lets navigate to **Churn Analysis Tab,** where we analyze the Customer Churn. This report and other two reports in Power BI are coming from the data Lakehouse that we created in earlier exercises.


![PowerBI Report Buttons](media/images/image3228.png)


15. The top left Scatter Chart shows the customers. The black color in the legend represents the customers who are more likely to churn, and the blue color shows the customers who are less likely to churn.
You can notice that the churn rate is low when the customer tenure is high as well as they spend higher amounts.

16. With this insight, Wide World Importers decides to target customers with lesser tenure and lesser spend amounts through their new campaigns.


![Scatter chart](media/images/image3229.png)


Now, let's go the Campaign Analytics. 


17.  Select the **Campaign Analytics** tab from the top right pane to navigate to the Campaign Analytics report.

![Select Campaigns Analytics](media/images/image3238.png)

18. In this Campaigns Analytics report, the Bar chart shows that the most popular campaigns launched are **gogreen** and **sustainablefashion**. 


![Campaigns report - Bar chart](media/images/image3239.png)


19. Click on **Website Analytics** from the top right pane to navigate to the Website Analytics Report.

![Website Analytics](media/images/imageWebsiteAnalytics.png)

Here we see an immediate problem for Wide World Importers.
The bounce rate is high. Looks like a large population of their customers/visitors leave their website without much activity.

As per this Donut chart it seems that the bounce rate is high because around 60 % of the online Customers are not happy. 

![Website Analysis Report page](media/images/image3242.png)

Let us understand more about these **not happy** customers. What age group are they? What do they shop for and what devices they use to shop online? 

20. Click on **Not Happy** on the Donut chart to filter the report page.

![Not Happy Customers](media/images/imageDonutChart.png)
  
The **site visitors by age group** chart shows that most of the "Not Happy" Customers are in the  age group of 21 to 40. So, it seems, millennials form the majority of unhappy online customers. Now, let us see what these millenials typically shop for online.
 
![Site visitors by age group](media/images/imageAgeGroup.png) 

![Repeat customers](media/images/imageSurfingBoard.png)

21.  We know that the millenials from the biggest customer segment are "Not Happy" when...

- they could not find the product they searched for on the website.
- Customers are also not happy when they were redirected to Wide World Importers website from a third party website.
- Customers are also not happy when the website user experience on their mobile phones is not good.
- they are not able find discounts on the website.

![Repeat Customers Chart](media/images/imageRepeatCustomersGraph.png)

Ultimately, we can say that we need to improve the user experience on the website for product search and make sure it renders correctly on the mobile phone.
  
Now, lets navigate to the top customer segment for additional insights generated.

22. Click on the **Top Segments** to show the details.

23. Click on the first bubble 1 see the details for Segment 1.

94.5% customers are not happy.


![Top Segments](media/images/image3248.png)


94.5 % of the "not happy" customers experienced failed product searches. These are the millennials who are using their mobile devices for shopping.


![Millenials using mobile phone](media/images/imagePowerBI.png)
 

As a result of this analysis, Wide World Importers reduce their bounce rate by implementing a mobile-friendly website with fast product search, focussing on high demand product for the millenials.
These changes not only improve the bounce rate dramatically, but they also reward Wide World Importers with an uprecedented sales at their Cyber Monday Sale event. 

Now, let us see how on an ongoing basis, if there are any business needs to run adhoc time-critical queries, it can be achieved via custom queries. 

We will discuss that in more detail in the next task.

------------- 

#### Task 3.3 (OPTIONAL): Explore SQL Analytics with Azure Synapse Serverless. <a name="sql-analytics-with-synapse"></a>

Data engineers are often required to support ad hoc and time-critical queries in addition to regular, scheduled reports.

In this task, you will learn how to perform custom SQL and business intelligence workloads on the data lake. You will query the data lake by using Azure Synapse Analytics. Specifically, you will rely upon Azure Synapse serverless SQL pools, which is a service that queries data in a data lake. Itâ€™s important to understand that the data can be queried without the need to move it into tables.



1. In the Azure portal web session (tab), in the search box (located across the top of the page), enter: **Synapse Analytics**

2. In the search results pane, select **Azure Synapse Analytics**.

![Select Azure Synapse Analytics](media/images/image3302.png)

3.	In the filtered results, select the Azure Synapse resource.

![Select Azure Synapse resource](media/images/image3303.png)

*Note: You might see Synapse workspace resource name with a different suffix in your Azure Portal.*

4. In the **Open Synapse Studio** tile, select the **Open** link.


![Open Synapse studio](media/images/image3304.png)

*Synapse Studio opens in a new web session (tab).*

5. In Synapse Studio, at the left, select the **Develop** hub icon (the third from the top).

*In Synapse Studio, you can use T-SQL to directly query data in a data lake by using a serverless SQL pool. That way, you can achieve rapid data exploration.*

6. In the **Develop** pane, expand **SQL scripts**.

7. Select the **1 Query Campaign And Twitter Data Using TSQL Language** script.

![Query Campaign And Twitter Data Using TSQL Language](media/images/image3307.png)

*You can directly query external files stored in ADLS Gen2 storage without first copying or loading the data into a specialized store. You can query the data by using familiar T-SQL syntax.*

8. In the **Connect to** dropdown list, ensure that **Built-in** is selected. 

*You will use the built-in endpoint for this service thatâ€™s provided within every Azure Synapse workspace. Itâ€™s a Synapse serverless SQL pool.*

9.	In the **Use database** dropdown list, ensure that **IgniteServerlessPool** is selected.

10.	To query the first 100 campaigns, in the script file, select lines 5-12.

11.	Select **Run**.

![Select Run](media/images/image3311.png)

12.	Review the query result in the lower pane.

We can directly query external files stored in Azure storage without copying or loading data into a specialized store, all using familiar T-SQL dialect. This is a quick and easy way to read the content of the files without pre-configuration.
A default, built-in, endpoint for this service is provided with in Synapse workspace.

*You will now create a view of the campaign file.*

13. To create a view that queries the first 100 campaigns, in the script file, select lines 35-44.

14.	Select **Run**.

![Select Run](media/images/image3314.png)

Letâ€™s create a view over Campaign file in Serverless pool. 

With the relevant metadata placed in an Azure storage account, views will allow us to reuse those queries in other places as well such as Power BI, in conjunction with serverless SQL pool.

*Executing ad hoc queries and creating views over data in the data lake by using a Synapse serverless SQL pool is straightforward*.

There you go. This is how easily data engineers can run adhoc time-critical queries on Synapse. We can do the same even with Databricks. Let us take a look.

----  


#### Task 3.4 (OPTIONAL): Explore SQL Analytics with Azure Databricks. <a name="explore-sql-analytics-with-azure-databricks"></a>


Azure Databricks provides an environment that allows you to run quick ad hoc SQL queries on your data lake. Queries support multiple visualization types that help you to explore query results from different perspectives.

In this task, you will explore some SQL analytics features of Azure Databricks, including export and import, and running a workbook.

1. In the Azure portal web session (tab), in the search box (located across the top of the page), enter: **Azure Databricks**

2. In the search results pane, select Azure Databricks.

![Select Azure Databricks](media/images/image3402.png)

3. In the **Azure Databricks** page, select the resource that has a name starting with **databricks**.

*Note: Each student has their own unique instance of this resource. Each Azure Databricks workspace is provisioned with a full-featured development environment.*

![Select Azure Databricks resource](media/images/image3403.png)

4. In the Azure Databricks resource page, select **Launch Workspace**.

![Select Azure Databricks resource](media/images/image2104.png)

*A new web session (tab) opens.*

*You will now export a Databricks notebook in HTML format to your local machine.*

5. In the Databricks web session (tab), at the left, select the Workspace icon (second from the top).


6. Select **04_SQL_Analytics_On_Delta_Live_Tables** notebook in Databricks workspace.

![Go to 04_SQL_Analytics_On_Delta_Live_Tables](media/images/image3405.png)

7. Review cmd 4 cell.

**Raw Twitter Data - Bronze**

*The bronze layer stores the raw, unprocessed data from Twitter API pulls. By leaving it in its raw state, there's an option to reprocess it for different purposes in the future. Thanks to Azure Data Lake Gen2, it is possible to maintain this data for as long as possible at a very low costs.*
*The bronze layer is usually the domain of data engineers who build pipelines to refine this data forward into the Silver layer.*

![Raw Twitter data](media/images/image3406.png)

8. Review cmd 7 cell.

**Filtered Twitter Data - Silver**

*In the Silver layer, the raw Twitter data is curated into something more usable for data scientists.*
*They can take these cleaned up data and develop features for machine learning models as well as aggregated analytical datasets for data analysts*.

![Filtered Twitter data](media/images/image3407.png)

9. Review cmd 9 cell.

**Curated Twitter Data - Gold**

*The Gold layer is to enhance and refine the silver layer data ets even further so that it is ready for fit-for-purpose tables and views for specific analytical needs.*
*Here we've augmented the Twitter data with a machine learning model to identify the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of each Tweet.*

![Curated Twitter data](media/images/image3408.png)

10. Review cmd 11 cell.

**Aggregations Are A Great User Experience Enhancement**

*By pre-emptively aggregating the data that rarely or slowly changes, it provides a great performance benefit to the end users.*
*The DLT pipeline performs this aggregation of hashtag counts by the geolocation of the Tweets.*
*By updating this everytime more Tweets are ingested, it is possible to keep the aggregation table up-to-date and then quickly consume and visualize it in tools like Power BI.*One nice feature of Databricks notebooks is if a cell produces a DataFrame output (like the one below), you can also profile the data as well as generate quick visualizations. Throw in Markdown and comments and notebooks are a super convenient way to collaborate and communicate with your team, leadership, customers, and other stakeholders.

![Aggregations Are A Great User Experience Enhancement](media/images/image3410.png)


11. Review cmd 20 cell.

**Z-Order Optimization**

*Z-Ordering is a technique to co-locate related information in the same set of files.*
*This co-locality is automatically used by Delta Lake on Databricks data-skipping algorithms.*
*This behavior dramatically reduces the amount of data that Delta Lake on Databricks needs to read.*

![Z-Order Optimization](media/images/image3411.png)

12. Review cmd 22 cell.

**Caching**

*Caching reduces scanning of the original files in future queries. It caches contents of a table in Apache Spark cache. If a query is cached, then a temperoray view is created for this query.*

![Caching](media/images/image3412.png)

13.  Review cmd 24 cell.

**Time Travel**

*In the audit history it is possible to see the history of the different versions of the table as well as load and display of any of those versions.*

![Time Travel](media/images/image3413.png)
